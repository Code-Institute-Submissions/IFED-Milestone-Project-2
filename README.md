# Pokemon Match Up

Pokemon match up is a simple single-player memory game which involves the player matching pairs of images in a grid.
The goal of the game is to match pairs of identical images of Pokemon characters, as fast as possible.
The player's skill and memory is tested and the fastest times are added to the leaderboard.
The theme of the game is centered around designs and characters from the Pokemon series of video games.

## User Experience (UX)

The goal this website aims to achieve is to provide an interactive and fun game for the purpose of entertainment.
The site should be intuitive and easy to use with a focus on allowing the user to play the game.
Initially, the landing page of the site will allow the user to choose from options, including 'Play', 'Help', and 'Leaderboard'.
The game itself utilises three different difficulty settings; Easy, Medium, and Hard.
This allows flexibility for the user to choose a desired difficulty level suitable for their skill level.
This simple layout and minimalist design will allow the player to focus on the game without distractions.
The game will utilise responsive design and will be playable in the browser in large screen as well as mobile devices.

### UX Framework

**1. Strategy**

Pokemon match up is a simple matching pairs game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the purposes of entertainment.
The goal is to allow users to interact with the website and to be able to complete and play the game, and to know their ranking after.

**2. Scope**

The scope of the website is to provide an easily understandable, interactive, and enjoyable experience for visitors of the website who aim to play the game.
In addition, repeat users will be able to view their previous rankings, so the website will entice users to come back.
The website aims to make use of artwork from the open source PokeAPI to integrate character sprites into the tiles of the matching pairs game.

*** Functional Requirements ***

The functional requirements of the website involve displaying a easy to navigate user interface and a variety of options for the user to choose.
Included in this is multiple difficulty levels which are able to be selected from the landing page.
The different difficulties affect the size of the grid available for the game, with higher difficulties utilising larger grids of more individual tiles.
In addition, the website should function to allow the user to pause the game and also view instructions on how to play at any time.
The menus should allow the user to return to the previous screen or close the dialog box.
A functioning leaderboard should alow the user to input their name alongside their time, which will be cached using the browser.
To mitigate blank screens between content loading, a loading screen will also be displayed.
A timer will be used and must accurately be able to start and stop when needed.
The final time should be displayed on the leaderboard if submitted

*** Content Requirements ***

The content of the website includes various images using the PokeAPI API on github; the sprite artwork is used to make the images for the mathing tiles in the game.
The text is minimal and simple to understand, as is appropriate for the target audience.
The game page will utilise a timer which should be displayed with the game, in full view.


**3. Structure**

The structure of the website is designed to be responsive and interactive, with clear placement of interface buttons and options.
The aim is to have two main pages; the landing page, and the game page.
All other content will be integrated using additional pop-up windows as they are optional and should not require the user to navigate to a different page.


**4. Skeleton**

The skeleton of the website is a minimalistic presentation of the elements that make up the two main pages of the site.
Firstly, the landing page will display a header image, and the main content menu.
Within the main content menu, several options are clearly displayed to allow the user to select their choice.
Simple language is used to allow the user to quickly and easily understand what the text represents.
The 'Play' option allows the user to play, the 'Instructions' option tells the user how to do this, and the 'Leaderboard' displays the leaderboard.
Various subheadings also will be used to show the user which menu they are currently in.
The options will create pop-up windows that display the information without making the user navigate away from the page.
Return/Close options allow the user to return to their previous point of the interface.

**5. Surface**

The surface of the website will build on the skeleton and make the website visually appealing and fun to interact with for the user.
Fans of Pokemon will immediately recognise the overall theme and imagery used, as well as the sprite artwork from the video game series.
Colours will be thematically appropriate and not distract from the game, as well as allow text to be read easily.
The fonts used are easy to read, and appropriate for the style of the game.
Controls include visual symbols and icons alongside them which allow the user to clearly understand the function of each control.
