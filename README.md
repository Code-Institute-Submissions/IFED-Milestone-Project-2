## User Experience (UX)

The goal this website aims to achieve is to provide an interactive and fun game for the purpose of entertainment.
The site should be intuitive and easy to use with a focus on allowing the user to play the game.
Initially, the landing page of the site will allow the user to choose from options, including 'Play', 'Help', and 'Leaderboard'.
The game itself utilises three different difficulty settings; Easy, Medium, and Hard.
This allows flexibility for the user to choose a desired difficulty level suitable for their skill level.
This simple layout and minimalist design will allow the player to focus on the game without distractions.
The game will utilise responsive design and will be playable in the browser in large screen as well as mobile devices.
